## Introduction

Chile trails only Israel and the UAE in vaccine doses per 100 inhabitants worldwide, but new cases have risen quickly amid mixed health messaging, travel over the southern hemisphere summer holidays and the circulation of new variants. This is a data exploration on covid-status in Chile. Let's have a look about how many cases, deaths, and how is the vaccinating status going in Chile.

The figure clearly shows there are some variables with missing values and all missing values are set as 0 before any data exploration.

```{r}

## Data exploration

# Daily updating covid-19 status

Let's have a look on the following plot to get a general idea about the new covid-19 cases (daily) in Chile over a year from February 2020 to today (September 2021).

```{r fig.cap="Daily cases in Chile"}
Chile$date = as.Date(Chile$date, "%Y-%m-%d")

Chile_plot1 <- Chile %>% 
  ggplot(aes(date, new_cases)) + 
  geom_col(colour = "dark grey") +
  scale_x_date(limits = c(as.Date("2020-02-01"), as.Date("2021-10-01")),
               breaks = seq.Date(as.Date("2020-02-01"), 
                                 as.Date("2021-09-14"), 
                                 by = "6 months"),
               labels = date_format("%Y-%m-%d")) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,15000),
                     expand = c(0,0)) +
  labs(x = "Date",
       y = "New Cases",
       title = "New covid 19 cases in Chile by time") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.background = element_rect(colour = "grey50", size = 2),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue3", colour = NA),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "gray60", 
                                          size = 0.8, 
                                          linetype = "dashed"),
        text = element_text(colour = "black"),
        axis.text = element_text(colour = "black"),
        axis.title = element_text(colour = "black"),
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "grey50", size = 1),
        plot.margin = margin(2, 2, 2, 2)) +
  geom_col(data = filter(Chile, (date > "2020-05-15" & date < "2020-06-30") | 
                           (date > "2021-03-01" & date < "2021-04-30") |
                           (date > "2021-05-15" & date < "2021-06-30")),
           color = "black")

ggplotly(Chile_plot1)
```

According to the plot, it is clearly to see there are three peaks of increasing cases, which are around June 2020, April 2021, and June 2021. The highest daily new case that Chile reached was **13990** on **06-06-2020**. It seems the month of **June** is always experiencing dramatic booming on new cases. Is this just a coincidence? Or it relates to any specific reason? Like transition season? Or lockdown restriction changes? I did a bit research on the lockdown policy of Chile, turns out the international travel in Chile is still allowed, and the flight are still chaep. Therefore, many Chileans took advantage of it to Miami, Brazil, the Dominican Republic and other destinations which causing the government to tighten restrictions for returning travelers. However, they did not tighten the restrictions until after the summer holiday season was over.


# Vaccination

```{r covidplot, fig.width = 12, fig.cap = "Daily deaths and vaccination trend in Chile", fig.align='center'}

c_dy <- Chile %>%
  select(date, new_deaths, people_vaccinated)

c_dy <- c_dy %>%
  xts(order.by = c_dy$date) 

c_graph <- dygraph(c_dy, main = "The effection of vaccination on daily cases and deaths") %>%
  dyAxis("y",label = "new_deaths") %>%
  dyAxis("y2", label = "people_vaccinated") %>%
  dySeries("new_deaths", 
           axis = "y", 
           label = "New deaths",
           stepPlot = TRUE, 
           fillGraph = TRUE, 
           color = "black") %>%
  dySeries("people_vaccinated", 
           axis = "y2", 
           stepPlot = TRUE, 
           color = "orange") %>%
  dyOptions(includeZero = TRUE, 
            axisLineColor = "navy", 
            gridLineColor = "lightblue") %>%
  dyRangeSelector() %>%
  dyHighlight(highlightCircleSize = 5, 
              highlightSeriesBackgroundAlpha = 0.2,
              hideOnMouseOut = FALSE) %>%
  dyLegend(show = "always", hideOnMouseOut = FALSE)

c_graph
```

Although people in Chile started to get vaccination from December 24th 2020, from previous plot we had known the daily cases were keeping going up for about four to six month, then it started to drop dramatically after June 2021. And from this plot, we focusing on the influence of vaccination on death. There is an interesting finding which the the number of daily death wasn't going down for nearly a year after people started to get vaccination. The number of death starts to show a trend to drop until recent month, after July 2021. It seems the influence of the vaccination needs a period of time to start.
