## Introduction

This is a data exploration on covid-status in Israel. Let's have a look about how many cases, deaths, and how is the vaccinating status going in Israel.

## Data description

The data is extracted from [Data on COVID-19 (coronavirus) by Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data). The original data is in tabular format with dimensions of **`r dim(covid_data)`**.

```{r}
Israel <- covid_data %>%
  filter(location == "Israel") %>%
  select("date", 
         "total_cases", "new_cases", 
         "total_deaths", "new_deaths",
         "total_tests", "new_tests",
         "total_vaccinations",
         "people_vaccinated",
         "people_fully_vaccinated",
         "population") %>%
  mutate(Month = month(date),
         Year = year(date)) %>%
  arrange(Year)

```

```{r}
vis_miss(Israel)
```

The figure clearly shows there are some variables with missing values and all missing values are set as 0 before any data exploration.

```{r}
Israel[is.na(Israel)] <- 0
```

## Data exploration

# Daily updating covid-19 status

The following table is a daily updating table. We could have a general idea about the covid-19 status in Israel. 

```{r}
Israel_brief <- Israel %>%
  select(-total_cases,
         -total_deaths,
         -total_tests,
         -new_tests,
         -total_vaccinations, 
         -population,
         -Month,
         -Year)

DT::datatable(Israel_brief,
              options = list(pageLength = 5),
              caption = "Daily Covid 19 Update in Israel") %>%
  formatStyle('new_cases',
              target = 'cell',
              backgroundColor = "lightblue")
```

There is an interesting finding in **New_deaths**: negative numbers are popped up. 

# The vaccination effect on death 

As the country with the highest rate of vaccination, it's good to have a look on the relationship between vaccination and death. 

```{r}
Israel_dv <- Israel %>%
  select("new_deaths",
         "people_vaccinated",
         "people_fully_vaccinated")

date_col <- Israel %>%
  select("date")

date <- as.Date(date_col$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")

Israel_dv <- cbind(Israel_dv, date) %>%
  pivot_longer(-date, names_to = "death_and_vaccinated_rate")

```

```{r}
d_v_plot <- ggplot(Israel_dv, aes(x = date, y = value,
                                  group = death_and_vaccinated_rate,
                                  color = death_and_vaccinated_rate)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Death & vaccination in Israel") +
  ylab("Number of people") 

d_v_plot
```

# Statistic summary

```{r}
Israel_sum1 <- Israel %>%
  group_by(Month, Year) %>%
  summarise(Cases = round(mean(new_cases),2),
            Death = round(mean(new_deaths),2),
            Tests = round(mean(new_tests),2),
            FullVaccinated = round(mean(people_fully_vaccinated),2))
```
 
```{r}
sum1 <- Israel_sum1 %>%
  pivot_longer(Cases : FullVaccinated,
               names_to = "Variables",
               values_to = "mean")

```

```{r}
Israel_sum2 <- Israel %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(Cases = round(sd(new_cases),2),
            Death = round(sd(new_deaths),2),
            Tests = round(sd(new_tests),2),
            FullVaccinated = round(sd(people_fully_vaccinated),2))


```

```{r}
sum2 <- Israel_sum2 %>%
  pivot_longer(Cases : FullVaccinated,
               names_to = "Variables",
               values_to = "sd")
```

```{r}
combine <- left_join(sum1, sum2)

combine %>% 
  DT::datatable(options = list(pagelength = 10))
```
