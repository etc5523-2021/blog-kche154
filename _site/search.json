to the plot, it is clearly to see there are three peaks of increasing cases, which are around June 2020, April 2021, and June 2021. The highest daily new case that Chile reached was 13990 on 06-06-2020. It seems the month of June is always experiencing dramatic booming on new cases. Is this just a coincidence? Or it relates to any specific reason? Like transition season?\r\n\r\nReference\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
